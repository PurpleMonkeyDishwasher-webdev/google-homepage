# Google Homepage V 1.0

This project is intended to recreate Google's homepage for the purposes of facilitating hands-on learning.  This is completed as part of the curriculum of The Odin Project.

Languages Used: HTML 5, CSS 3

Gotchas: Learning how to create the Google homepage required a great deal of modulation, even more than I was expecting.  Something as simple as the header contains many nuanced properties that cannot be easily gleaned from even the source code (e.g. How do you stop header elements from stacking onto each other when the viewport changes?  This took me too long at first!).  Once I was able to figure out a rhythm with alignment and using flexbox, as well as when it is simplier not to use flexbox, the project really come together.  It was an excellent exercise to increase my awareness of the tools available to rearrange elements in CSS, and it increased my appreciation of beautiful code!

What could be improved: A more thorough investigation into reflexivity of the content by way of viewport adjustments could be undertaken.  Cleaning up any redundancies in the code, as well as incorporating more efficient methods, could be a good idea in the future after learning more about what are some best practices (this is something I'm particularly interested in looking into).
